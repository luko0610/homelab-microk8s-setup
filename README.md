# homelab-microk8s-setup
This repo will contain all configuration files for my home kubernetes lab consisting of 3 Lenovo M910 tiny pcs's with i5 and 16GB of RAM each.
All three machines are running Ubuntu Server 22.04 at the moment, for kubernetes I decided to use microk8s.

Might in the future reinstall with ODK as I am used to the fancy OpenShift web interface. The regular kubernetes dashboard doesn't really convince me.
